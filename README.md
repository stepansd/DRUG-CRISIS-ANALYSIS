## Project Overview

This project analyses long-term global mortality related to illicit drug use, using aggregated country-level data from 1990–2019.  
We explore worldwide and national trends, identify high-risk countries, and build forecasting models to understand how the crisis may evolve.

**Key questions:**
- How have drug-related deaths evolved globally over time?
- Which countries experience the highest mortality?
- How do trends differ between Estonia, the USA, and Russia?
- Can we predict future mortality based on historical dynamics?

## Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle — *Illicit Drugs Dataset*  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/illicit-drugs

**File used:**  
`deaths-illicit-drugs NEW.csv`

**Variables include:**
- deaths from drug use disorders  
- deaths from all causes attributable to drug use  
- country name  
- ISO code  
- year (1990–2019)

Data preprocessing:
- Renamed long columns  
- Converted textual numeric fields (with dots)  
- Removed missing/extreme inconsistent rows  
- Added derived metric:  
  `share_disorders_in_attrib = drug_disorder_deaths / all_drug_attrib_raw`

## Methods

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Global trends for both mortality indicators  
- Latest-year ranking of countries (absolute & relative mortality)  
- Comparison of Estonia, USA, Russia  
- Heatmap of top 20 countries  
- Derived ratio analysis  

### 2. Time Series Modelling
- Tested stationarity using ADF  
- Built **ARIMA(1,1,1)** for global mortality  
- Forecasted next 10 years with uncertainty bands  
- Country-level ARIMA example: United States

## Key Results

### Global trends:
- Drug-related mortality shows a clear long-term upward trend.
- Drug-attributable deaths and drug-use-disorder deaths grow in parallel.

### High-burden countries:
- Several countries consistently report very high mortality levels.
- Others have extremely high **share** of drug-use-disorder deaths within all drug-attributable deaths.

### Focus countries:
- USA: strong increasing trend  
- Russia: high but fluctuating  
- Estonia: lower values but visible variation over time  

### Forecasting:
- ARIMA predicts continued increase in global mortality.
- Forecast uncertainty grows over time.
