## 🔍 Project Overview

This project analyses long-term global mortality related to illicit drug use, using aggregated country-level data from 1990–2019.

We explore worldwide and national trends, identify high-risk countries, and build forecasting models to understand how the crisis may evolve.

### Key Questions
- How have drug-related deaths evolved globally over time?  
- Which countries experience the highest mortality?  
- How do trends differ between Estonia, the USA, and Russia?  
- Can we predict future mortality based on historical dynamics?

##  Dataset

**Source:** Kaggle — *Illicit Drugs Dataset*  
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/illicit-drugs

**File used:**  
`deaths-illicit-drugs NEW.csv`

### Variables include:
- deaths from drug use disorders  
- deaths from all causes attributable to drug use  
- country name  
- ISO code  
- year (1990–2019)

### Data Preprocessing:
- Renamed long columns  
- Converted textual numeric fields  
- Removed missing / inconsistent rows  
- Added derived metric:  
  `share_disorders_in_attrib = drug_disorder_deaths / all_drug_attrib_raw`

##  Methods

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Global trends for both mortality indicators  
- Latest-year ranking of countries (absolute & relative mortality)  
- Comparison of Estonia, USA, Russia  
- Heatmap of top 20 countries  
- Ratio-based analysis  

### 2. Time Series Modelling
- Stationarity tested (ADF)  
- ARIMA(1,1,1) built for global mortality  
- 10-year forecast with uncertainty bands  
- Country-level forecast example: United States

##  Key Results

### Global Trends
- Strong long-term **upward** trend in drug-related mortality.  
- Both “drug-use-disorder” and “drug-attributable” deaths grow in parallel.

### High-Burden Countries
- Several countries consistently report **very high** mortality.  
- Some countries have extremely high **share** of drug-use-disorder deaths among all drug-attributable deaths.

### Focus Countries
- **USA:** strong increasing trend  
- **Russia:** high but unstable  
- **Estonia:** low absolute values but visible variation  

### Forecasting
- ARIMA forecasts continued growth in global deaths.  
- Uncertainty widens with time.
